# Bulk File Renamer: Fast, Secure & Local Batch Renaming

Tired of manually renaming hundreds of files one by one? Whether it's a messy photo collection or a disorganized set of project documents, our **Bulk File Renamer** provides a professional, instant solution directly in your browser.

## Why Choose Our Local Bulk Renamer?

Most online tools require you to upload your files to their servers. We do things differently. Following our **Just Local** philosophy, all processing happens on your machine:

* **100% Privacy Guaranteed**: Your files never leave your computer. Processing is done locally via JavaScript.
* **Instant Performance**: No upload or download wait times. Rename thousands of files in milliseconds.
* **Safe & Secure**: Ideal for sensitive documents, private photos, or internal company files.
* **Zero Cost**: No limits on file count or size, no registration, and no hidden fees.


## Powerful Features for Organized Workflows

Our tool offers flexible rules to handle any renaming logic you need:

### 1. Custom Prefix & Suffix
Add specific text to the beginning or end of your filenames. Perfect for adding dates (e.g., `2024_`) or status tags (e.g., `_Final`) to entire folders at once.

### 2. Intelligent Auto-Numbering
Turn a chaotic list into an ordered sequence. You can enable numbering to add increments (e.g., `_01`, `_02`) to the end of each file, ensuring perfect chronological or alphabetical order.

### 3. Real-time Live Preview
See your changes before they happen. As you type your Prefix or Suffix, the "New Name" column updates instantly. This eliminates errors and ensures your files look exactly how you want them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there a limit on the number of files?**
The only limit is your computer's memory (RAM). You can typically process hundreds of files simultaneously without any lag.

**Does this work on all file types?**
Yes! You can rename images, documents, videos, or any other file format. Our tool handles them all.

**What happens to my original files?**
Nothing. Our tool creates copies with the new names and packages them into a ZIP. Your original files on your hard drive remain untouched until you decide to replace them with the new ones.
