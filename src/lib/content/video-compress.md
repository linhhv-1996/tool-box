# Compress Video Online: 100% Private & No Upload

Tired of waiting for huge video files to upload just to shrink them? Or worried about your private videos being stored on a random cloud server? Our **Compress Video tool** brings the power of industry-standard professional software directly to your browser. 

Using **FFmpeg.wasm (WebAssembly)**, we process your video **client-side**. This means your video stays on your computer, providing 100% privacy and security while you **reduce video file size** for free.


## Why Use a Browser-Based Video Compressor?

Most online video compressors (like Clideo or Kapwing) upload your data to their backend. This is risky for sensitive content and slow if your internet is weak. Our tool offers a revolutionary alternative:

* **Absolute Privacy:** Your video **never leaves your device**. No server-side processing, no data logging, and no leaks.
* **No Watermarks:** Unlike other "free" tools, we don't ruin your video with ugly logos. You get clean, professional results.
* **Professional Quality (FFmpeg):** We use **FFmpeg**, the same engine used by professional video editors, compiled to run in your browser.
* **No Upload Limits:** Since there is no upload, you can process large video files that other sites would reject or charge you to handle.


## High-Performance Compression Features

### 1. Advanced Codec Support
Our **WASM video compressor** supports the most popular formats and containers:
* **MP4:** The universal standard for web and mobile.
* **MOV:** Perfect for iPhone and Mac users.
* **WebM & MKV:** Ideal for high-quality web streaming and archives.

### 2. Optimize for Social Media & Email
Easily **shrink videos for Discord, Slack, or Email** attachments. By adjusting the target bitrate or quality, you can ensure your video fits under the 25MB or 50MB limits common on these platforms.

### 3. Transparent Processing
Since the compression runs on your hardware, the speed is determined by your CPU. You have full control over the process, and you can see the progress in real-time without worrying about "Server busy" errors.


## Common Use Cases: Who is this for?
