## Compress Video Online – Safe Browser-Based Video Compression

The **Compress Video** tool allows you to **reduce video file size directly in your browser** using **FFmpeg compiled to WebAssembly (ffmpeg.wasm)**. All video processing runs **client-side**, meaning your video files are never uploaded to any server.

This tool is intended for users who prioritize **privacy and data control** over raw compression speed.


## Video Compression Without Uploading Files

Most online video compressors upload videos to remote servers for processing. This is often faster, but it introduces privacy risks and file size restrictions.

This tool works entirely in the browser:
- Videos are processed locally using ffmpeg.wasm
- No server uploads or cloud processing
- No file storage or tracking
- No software installation required

If you are searching for **compress video online without upload** or **client-side video compression**, this tool matches that use case.


## Why Use FFmpeg in the Browser?

### 1. Privacy-First Video Compression
All video data stays on your device during compression.

- Videos never leave your browser
- No network transfer of video content
- Safe for private, personal, or sensitive videos

This makes it one of the safest ways to compress video files online.


### 2. Predictable and Transparent Processing
Because compression runs locally:
- Speed depends on your device’s CPU and memory
- Large videos may take longer to process
- No waiting for uploads or server queues

This trade-off provides full control and transparency over how your videos are handled.


### 3. Proven Compression with FFmpeg
The tool uses **FFmpeg**, the industry-standard video processing engine, compiled to WebAssembly.

- Reliable video encoding and compression
- Broad codec and container support
- Consistent output quality across platforms

While ffmpeg.wasm is slower than native or server-based FFmpeg, it ensures maximum portability and security.


### 4. No Server-Imposed File Size Limits
Since there is no backend processing:
- No artificial upload limits
- No subscription-based restrictions
- Compression is limited only by available device resources

Large video files can be processed as long as your browser can handle them.


## How to Compress Videos Online

1. **Select Video File**  
   Drag and drop a video file into the tool or select it from your device.

2. **Choose Compression Settings**  
   Select output quality or target size based on your needs.

3. **Compress and Download**  
   Click **Compress Video** and wait while ffmpeg.wasm processes the file.  
   Once completed, download the compressed video.

Original video files remain unchanged.


## Supported Video Formats

The video compressor supports common formats, depending on browser support:
- MP4
- MOV
- WebM
- MKV
- AVI

Codec availability may vary across browsers.


## Important Notes About Performance

- Video compression is **CPU-intensive**
- Processing time increases with video length and resolution
- Performance varies by device and browser

For maximum stability, it is recommended to keep the browser tab active during compression.


## Browser Compatibility

The Compress Video tool works on modern browsers that support WebAssembly:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Desktop browsers provide the best performance due to higher available resources.
