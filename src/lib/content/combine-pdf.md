# Merge PDF Files Locally with 100% Privacy

Stop uploading your sensitive documents to random servers. Our **Combine PDF** tool allows you to merge multiple PDF files into one single document directly in your browser. No data ever leaves your device.

## Why Use a Client-Side PDF Merger?

Most online PDF tools require you to upload your files to their cloud servers. This poses a significant security risk for legal contracts, financial statements, and personal IDs. **JUSTLOCALTOOLS_** solves this by using advanced in-browser processing.

### 1. Absolute Privacy & Security
Your files are processed locally using your device's hardware (CPU and RAM). Since there is no server-side upload, your data remains 100% private. Even if your internet connection cuts out, the tool keeps working.

### 2. Zero Wait Time
Forget about slow upload speeds or waiting in a "processing queue." Our tool leverages the power of `pdf-lib` to concatenate PDF buffers instantly, regardless of your internet bandwidth.

### 3. No File Size Limits*
While most "free" online tools cap your file size at 50MB to save their server costs, we don't. The only limit is your browser's available memory. Merge large high-resolution documents without fear of being cut off.

## How to Combine PDF Files Online Safely

Follow these three simple steps to merge your documents:

*  **Select or Drop Files**: Click the upload area or drag your PDF files into the queue.
*  **Verify Order**: Review your files in the list. You can remove and re-add files to ensure the correct sequence.
*  **Combine & Download**: Click the "Combine & Download" button. The merged PDF will be generated and saved to your default download folder immediately.
