# Compress Images Online: Fast, Private & WASM-Powered (No Upload)

In today’s digital world, large images slow down websites and eat up storage. But why should you risk your privacy by uploading your personal photos to a cloud server? Our **Compress Images tool** uses cutting-edge **WebAssembly (WASM)** technology to optimize your images directly in your browser. 

Experience lightning-fast **image compression online** with zero uploads, absolute privacy, and professional-grade quality.


## Why Our WASM-Powered Image Compressor is Better

Most online compressors like TinyPNG or ILoveIMG require you to upload files to their servers. This is slow, has file size limits, and poses a privacy risk. Our tool is a **client-side image optimizer** that offers:

* **Total Privacy:** Your photos **never leave your device**. All processing happens in your browser's memory.
* **Blazing Speed:** By using **WASM (WebAssembly)**, we run high-performance image codecs (like MozJPEG and OxiPNG) at near-native speeds. No waiting for upload or download bars.
* **No File Limits:** Compress 10MB or 100MB images without "Premium" restrictions. Your only limit is your own computer's RAM.
* **Works Offline:** Once the page is loaded, you can turn off your Wi-Fi and continue to **shrink images** perfectly.


## High-Performance Compression for Every Format

### 3. WebP: The Future of Web Images
Need even smaller files? Convert and **compress WebP images** for the best performance on modern browsers. Ideal for developers looking to boost their **Google PageSpeed Insights** score.
