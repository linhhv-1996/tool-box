# Split PDF Files Locally with 100% Privacy

Stop risking your sensitive documents by sending them to unknown servers just to extract a few pages. Our **Split PDF** tool allows you to divide, extract, and reorganize PDF files directly in your browser. Your data never leaves your device.

## Why Use a Client-Side PDF Splitter?

Most online tools require you to upload your files to the cloud for processing. This poses a significant security risk for documents like tax returns, medical records, or legal contracts. **JUSTLOCALTOOLS_** handles everything locally to ensure absolute safety.

### 1. Absolute Privacy & Security
Since the splitting process happens within your browser's RAM, we never see your files. No data is transmitted over the internet, making it the safest way to handle personal information.

### 2. Instant Results
Forget about slow upload speeds or waiting in server queues. By leveraging your device's CPU power, pages are extracted and packaged into a ZIP file almost instantly.

### 3. Flexible Page Selection
Whether you need a single page, a range (e.g., 1-5), or multiple separate sections (e.g., 1, 3, 7-10), our tool handles complex range syntax with ease.

## How to Split PDF Files Online Safely

Follow these simple steps to extract your pages:

*  **Select PDF File**: Drag and drop or click to select the PDF you want to split.
*  **Enter Page Ranges**: Input the page numbers or ranges you need. For example, enter `1, 3, 5-10` to get page 1, page 3, and the segment from 5 to 10 as separate files.
*  **Split & Download**: Click "Split & Export ZIP". The extracted pages will be bundled into a single ZIP file for easy downloading.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I split password-protected PDFs?
If the PDF is password-protected, you need to unlock it first. Please use our **Unlock PDF** tool. This tool works best on standard, non-encrypted PDF files.

### Is there a file size limit?
The only limit is your browser's available RAM. Since there is no server upload, you can process large documents that would typically be rejected by other online utilities.
