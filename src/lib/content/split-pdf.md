# Split PDF Online: Extract Pages Securely (No Upload & 100% Private)

Need to pull a few pages out of a massive PDF report? Or perhaps you need to separate a multi-page contract into individual files? Our **Split PDF tool** offers a professional, browser-based solution to **extract PDF pages** without ever uploading your sensitive data to the cloud.

Experience the freedom of a **client-side PDF splitter** that is faster, safer, and more flexible than traditional online converters.


## Why This is the Best Online PDF Splitter for Privacy

Most online "PDF breakers" require you to send your documents to their servers. If you're handling confidential tax returns, medical records, or legal briefs, this is a major security loophole. Our tool is built for total data control:

* **Zero Uploads (Client-Side):** Your PDF never leaves your computer. We use `pdf-lib` to process the file structure directly in your browser's RAM.
* **Instant Extraction:** No waiting for upload queues or server processing. Pages are separated at the speed of your device’s CPU.
* **100% Secure:** Since there is no data transfer, your "private" documents stay truly private.
* **No Software to Install:** Get the power of Adobe Acrobat's "Organize Pages" feature for free, directly in your browser.


## Advanced Features for Precise PDF Splitting

### 1. Flexible Page Range Syntax
Don't be limited by simple "Split all" options. Our tool supports advanced syntax to help you **extract exactly what you need**:
* **Single Pages:** Type `1, 3, 5` to get those specific pages.
* **Page Ranges:** Type `10-20` to extract a continuous block.
* **Complex Combinations:** Mix them up like `1, 4, 8-12, 25` to handle complex document reorganization in one go.

### 2. Individual File Export (ZIP Bundled)
Every page or range you specify is exported as a separate, high-quality PDF file. To save you time, we bundle all your new documents into a single **ZIP archive** for a clean, one-click download.

### 3. No File Size or Page Limits
Tired of "File too large" errors? Because we don't use server bandwidth, you can **split large PDF files** containing hundreds of pages without being blocked or forced to pay for a premium subscription.


## Common Use Cases: How to Use the PDF Extractor

* **Legal & Real Estate:** Separate individual exhibits or addenda from a large master contract.
* **Academic Research:** Extract specific chapters from a heavy eBook or research paper for easier study.
* **Finance & Accounting:** Split a yearly statement into monthly reports for better organization.
