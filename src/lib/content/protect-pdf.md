# Protect PDF Files with Local Encryption

Secure your sensitive documents by adding a strong password without ever uploading them to a server. Our **Protect PDF** tool encrypts your files directly in your browser, ensuring your data and your password remain 100% private.

## Why Secure Your PDFs Locally?

Sharing documents like financial reports, contracts, or personal IDs requires extra security. Standard online tools ask you to upload these files, which is a major privacy risk. **JUSTLOCALTOOLS_** solves this by using client-side processing.

### 1. Unmatched Privacy
Your password and your file never leave your computer. The encryption happens in your browser's RAM, so even we cannot see your information or the password you choose.

### 2. Industry Standard Security
We use standard PDF encryption protocols to ensure that once your file is protected, it cannot be opened without the correct password by any PDF reader (Adobe Acrobat, Chrome, etc.).

### 3. No File Size Limits
Since there is no server upload or download involved, you can protect massive PDF documents instantly without worrying about bandwidth or subscription limits.

## How to Password Protect Your PDF

*  **Select Your File**: Drag and drop your PDF into the secure zone.
*  **Set a Strong Password**: Enter the password you want to use to lock the file.
*  **Protect & Download**: Click "Protect PDF". Your new, encrypted file will be ready for download immediately.
