## Why use our local Image to PDF converter?

### 1. Privacy First
Most online converters upload your files to their servers. Our tool uses **client-side technology** (pdf-lib), ensuring your images stay on your device. It's the safest way to handle personal IDs, receipts, or private documents.

### 2. No File Limits or Quality Loss
Since we don't rely on server bandwidth, you can convert large image files without worrying about upload limits. We preserve the original resolution of your images to ensure your PDF is crisp and clear.

### 3. Smart Reordering
Our intuitive drag-and-drop interface allows you to sequence your pages exactly how you want them before finalizing the document.
