# iPhone Photo Converter: Convert HEIC to JPG Online (No Upload & 100% Private)

## How to Convert iPhone Photos to JPG (3 Easy Steps)

## What is HEIC and Why Convert It?

Apple introduced **HEIC** with iOS 11 to save storage space while maintaining high image quality. However, many systems still don't support it:
* **Windows 10/11:** Often requires a paid extension to view HEIC files in the Photos app.
* **Android:** Older versions cannot open HEIC natively.
* **Websites:** Most social media and job portals only accept JPG or PNG.

Our tool bridges this gap, giving you the compatibility of JPG with the convenience of an online tool.
