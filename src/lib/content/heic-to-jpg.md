# iPhone Photo Converter: Convert HEIC to JPG or PNG Free & Privately

If you are an iPhone or iPad user, you are likely familiar with the **HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container)** format. While it is great for saving storage space, this format can be difficult to open on older Windows PCs, Android devices, or various online photo editing platforms.

Our **iPhone Photo Converter** is designed to solve this problem quickly, efficiently, and with absolute security.


## Why Choose iPhone Photo Converter at JustLocalTools?

Most online HEIC converters require you to upload your photos to their servers. This not only poses a privacy risk but also takes time to upload and download. JustLocalTools offers a better way:

### 1. 100% Local Browser Processing
Unlike other services, your photos **never leave your device**. The conversion process happens directly within your browser's memory. This ensures 100% privacy for your personal photos.

### 2. Flexible Output Formats
You can easily choose to convert to **JPG** for maximum compatibility or **PNG** if you need to maintain transparency or for professional design work.

### 3. High-Speed Batch Conversion
Don't waste time converting photos one by one. Our tool supports uploading and processing dozens of HEIC files simultaneously, then bundles them into a single ZIP file for convenient downloading.


## How to Convert HEIC to JPG/PNG in 3 Simple Steps

1. **Upload Photos:** Drag and drop your `.heic` or `.heif` files into the Dropzone area above, or click to select files from your device.
2. **Select Format:** Choose between **JPG** (JPEG) or **PNG** based on your specific needs.
3. **Convert & Download:** Click the "Convert" button and wait a few seconds. Once finished, you can preview the converted images and download the ZIP archive to your machine.


## What is HEIC? Why Does Apple Use This Format?

**HEIC** (short for High Efficiency Image Coding) is a variant of the HEIF format that Apple started using with iOS 11.

* **Saves Space:** HEIC can compress images up to 2x better than JPG while maintaining the same image quality.
* **Advanced Features:** It allows for storing multiple images in one file (like Live Photos), supports 16-bit color, and preserves important metadata like GPS location and camera settings.

However, due to compatibility issues with older software and non-Apple devices, having a reliable HEIC to JPG converter is essential for easy sharing.
