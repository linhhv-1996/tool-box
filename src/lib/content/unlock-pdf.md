# Unlock PDF Files and Remove Passwords Locally

Need to remove a password from a PDF document? Our **Unlock PDF** tool allows you to decrypt your files and remove security restrictions directly in your browser. No files are uploaded to any server.

## Secure and Private PDF Decryption

Most online PDF unlockers require you to send your protected documents to their servers. This is a huge privacy risk, especially since you are also providing the password. **JUSTLOCALTOOLS_** processes everything locally.

### 1. Complete Confidentiality
Since the decryption happens in your browser's RAM, we never see your file or the password you enter. Your sensitive data stays on your machine.

### 2. Instant Password Removal
By using high-performance WASM technology, the decryption process is nearly instantaneous. Once you provide the correct password, your unlocked file is ready immediately.

### 3. Remove All Restrictions
Our tool doesn't just remove the "Open" password; it also strips away permissions restrictions, allowing you to print, copy text, or edit the file as needed.

## How to Unlock Your PDF

*  **Select Protected File**: Upload the password-protected PDF you want to unlock.
*  **Enter Existing Password**: Provide the current password required to open the document.
*  **Unlock & Download**: Click "Unlock PDF". The security will be removed, and you can download the clean version instantly.

*Note: You must know the correct password to unlock the file. This tool is not for "cracking" passwords.*
