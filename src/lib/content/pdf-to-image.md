## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is it safe to convert my PDF here?
Yes. We use client-side technology. Your PDF data is processed locally and is never uploaded to any server.

### What is the "Scale" option?
Scale determines the resolution of the output image. A scale of 1x is the standard size, while 2x or 3x provides higher density (DPI), which is better for printing or zooming in.

### Can I convert password-protected PDFs?
You will need to unlock the PDF using our **Unlock PDF** tool before converting it to images.
