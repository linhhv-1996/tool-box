# PDF to Image Converter: High-Quality PNG & JPG (100% Private)

Need to extract pages from a PDF as high-quality images? Most online converters produce blurry, low-resolution files and require you to upload your documents to their servers. Our **PDF to Image Converter** is different. It uses powerful **client-side rendering** to turn your PDF pages into crisp, professional images directly in your browser.

Whether you're converting a presentation, a contract, or a design portfolio, your files **never leave your device**, ensuring total privacy and security.


## Why This is the Best PDF to Image Converter Online

When it comes to **converting PDF to PNG or JPG**, quality and security are the two biggest concerns. Our tool excels in both:

* **100% Private & Secure:** No backend, no uploads. Your sensitive PDF data is processed in your browser's RAM and cleared instantly when you're done.
* **Crystal Clear Quality:** Unlike other tools that output low-res thumbnails, we allow you to **adjust the rendering scale (DPI)** to ensure your text and graphics remain razor-sharp.
* **Blazing Fast Speed:** Skip the upload and download queues. Rendering starts the moment you select your file, using your local CPU power.
* **No Page Limits:** Convert a 5-page or a 500-page PDF without any artificial restrictions or "Premium" upgrades.


## Pro Features for High-Resolution Conversion

### 1. Adjustable Rendering Scale (Up to 3x)
Resolution matters. Our tool gives you control over the output density:
* **1x Scale:** Standard resolution for quick previews and small file sizes.
* **2x Scale (Recommended):** High-definition output, perfect for documents and presentations.
* **3x Scale:** Ultra-high resolution for detailed graphics, blueprints, or printing.

### 2. Choose Your Format: PNG vs. JPG

### 3. Bulk Download as ZIP
