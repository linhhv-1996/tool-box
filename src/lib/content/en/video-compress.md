# Compress Video Online: 100% Private, No Upload Required

Tired of waiting for huge video files to upload just to reduce their size? Worried that your private or work videos are being stored on unknown cloud servers? Our **Compress Video Online** tool solves all of that.

We **do NOT use FFmpeg.wasm**. Instead, we use a **custom-built video compression library**, optimized to run **directly inside your browser** with extremely fast performance. All processing happens **client-side**, so your video **never leaves your device**.


## Why Choose a Browser-Based Video Compressor?

Most online video compressors (such as Clideo or Kapwing) require you to upload your files to their servers. This approach is slow, risky for sensitive content, and often comes with file size limits. Our solution is fundamentally different:

* **100% Privacy Guaranteed:** Videos are processed entirely in your browser. No uploads, no server storage, no tracking.
* **No Watermarks:** Your compressed videos stay clean and professional, with zero branding.
* **Blazing-Fast Performance:** Our proprietary compression library is optimized for modern browsers and efficiently uses your CPU.
* **No File Size Limits:** Since nothing is uploaded, there are no artificial restrictions on video size.
* **Works Even on Slow Internet:** Once the page is loaded, compression works without relying on your connection.
